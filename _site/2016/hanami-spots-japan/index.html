    <h1 class="post-title">Top Ten 'Hanami' Spots in Japan</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="post">
    <p>Cherry blossoms are one of the most iconic natural beauties of Japan. Throughout the country, their brief but gorgeous blooming period is celebrated in an event called hanami, essentially a picnic among the blossoms with friends or loved ones. To help you plan the perfect hanami, we present 10 must-see spots throughout the country.</p>

<p><strong>10. Kumamoto Castle (Kumamoto)</strong></p>

<p>Kumamoto Prefecture—perhaps best known for its adorable bear mascot Kumamon—sits on the southern island of Kyushu. The castle here isn’t only architecturally impressive, as one of the most complete castle experiences in Japan, but also culturally, as it was the location of an important battle during the Satsuma Rebellion, a rebellion incited by Saigo Takamori that served as inspiration for the film The Last Samurai. While always a popular tourist destination, crowds flock in late March to see the hundreds of cherry blossoms trees in bloom. The grounds are especially impressive from the top floor of castle, which costs ¥500 to enter.</p>

<p><strong>9. Shinjuku Gyoen (Tokyo)</strong></p>

<p>Shinjuku Gyoen is a beautiful park in the heart of Tokyo, just a short walk from Shinjuku station. Although it costs only ¥200 to enter, that’s a small price to pay for the spacious lawns perfect for laying a blanket down, enjoying your favorite foods, and gazing on more than 1,000 cherry blossom trees contained within, which are at their prime in early April. While hanami season can be a temperamental, fickle thing, Shinjuku Gyoen contains early and late blooming trees, which makes it perfect for those who miss the elusive prime time viewing.</p>

<p><strong>8. Kema Sakuranomiya Park (Osaka)</strong></p>

<p>Kema Sakuranomiya Park is located in Osaka, and covers approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) between Tenma Bridge and the Okawa Bridge. There are over 4,000 trees along the riverside, which typically bloom in early April. While the park is free to enter and there are plenty of spots along the river perfect for a picnic, there are also water buses that travel up and down the river, providing a perfect, effortless view of the whole park for a reasonable fee.</p>

<p><strong>7. Mount Yoshino (Nara)</strong></p>

<p>Located in Nara Prefecture, Mount Yoshino has been a popular hanami destination for centuries. The mountain is covered by 30,000 (!!!) cherry blossom trees that bloom from early to mid April. Due to the difference in elevation throughout its four main visiting areas, the blooming is staggered by a short period between the upper and lower sections. While there are plenty of places to stop and visit along the way, the view at the top must be seen to be believed!</p>

<p><strong>6. Hirosaki Castle (Aomori)</strong></p>

<p>On the northern tip of Japan’s main island of Honshu is Aomori Prefecture, home of Hirosaki Castle, former seat of the Tsuruga clan. While the castle’s walls and foundation are currently under construction, the castle grounds are open, and the main keep is scheduled to reopen in April 2016—just in time for the late April cherry blossom blooming, and Cherry Blossom Festival! Part of what sets the view here apart from other viewing destinations are “cherry blossom tunnels,” as well as the petal-filled moats, which you can experience firsthand in a romantic rental boat. It costs ¥500 for entry into the grounds and garden (although the boat will cost extra), and is a short bus ride from Hirosaki Station.</p>

<p><strong>5. Hanamiyama Park (Fukushima)</strong></p>

<p>Outside a small village in Fukushima Prefecture is Hanamiyama, a hillside park whose cherry blossom trees were originally planted by local farmers, and grew into the hanami hot spot it is today. Because it’s located in the northern region of Tohoku, the trees don’t bloom until mid-April. While the park is somewhat remote, that seclusion offers a lovely mountain view juxtaposed with the blossoms. And a ¥250 shuttle bus from Fukushima Station makes getting there a breeze.</p>

<p><strong>4. Goryokaku Fort (Hokkaido)</strong></p>

<p>Goryokaku Fort is in Hakodate, on Japan’s northernmost island, Hokkaido. A short tram ride from Hakodate Station will bring you to the unique, star-shaped fort, which was turned into a public park in the early 1900s. Over 1,000 cherry blossom trees were planted along its moats, creating one of Hokkaido’s best hanami spots. Blooming usually starts in early May, and the Goryokaku Tower offers an incredible bird’s-eye view of the fortress that can’t be beat for only ¥840.</p>

<p><strong>3. Odawara Castle (Kanagawa)</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve read this article then you know I’m a huge fan of Odawara Castle, the former seat of power of the Hojo in Kanagawa Prefecture. Between the farmer’s markets, ninja-related events and the fact that the castle keep has reopened to the public, a trip to the grounds would be worth it even without the added bonus of hundreds of gorgeous cherry blossoms, which usually bloom in late March. The park is also open for night viewings, making it a lovely spot for the perfect yozakura date night.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Philosopher’s Walk (Kyoto)</strong></p>

<p>The Philosopher’s Walk is a 2-kilometer-long (1.24 miles) path that follows the canal in Kyoto’s Higashiyama district, lined with hundreds of cherry blossom trees. Named after Nishida Kitaro, a famous Japanese philosopher believed to walk the route daily on his way to Kyoto University, the path winds between Ginkakuji, the Silver Pavilion, and the neighborhood of Nanzenji. Blossoming is at its best in early April, and although the path is narrow, it’s closed to bicycles and vehicles. It’s the perfect place for sharing a breathtaking walk with a special someone.</p>

<p><strong>1. Himeji Castle (Hyogo)</strong></p>

<p>Also called the White Heron Castle due to its pristine exterior, Himeji is widely considered to be one of (if not the) most beautiful places in the country, and one of the few castles not destroyed by war or natural disaster. It’s a national treasure, as well as a World Heritage Site, and is well worth the trip to Hyogo Prefecture. While it was under construction for years, it has reopened and only costs ¥1,000 (about US$8.80) to enter. Combine the historical and cultural significance with the fact that cherry blossoms bloom on the castle grounds in early April, and you’ve got a dream destination not to be missed by any hanami enthusiast!</p>
